        <h2 style="font-size: 60px;">What is Visual Studio?</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 40px;">Microsoft Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft.
             It is used to develop computer programs,
             as well as websites, web apps, 
            web services and mobile apps. ... Visual Studio includes a code editor supporting
             IntelliSense (the code completion component) as well as code refactoring.</p>

             <p style="font-size: 40px;">In computer technology, a console can mean different things depending on the context. It usually means a combination of a display
                  monitor and an input device, usually a keyboard and mouse pair,
                  which allows a user to input commands and receive visual output
                   from a computer or computer system.</p>

                   <p style="font-size: 30px;">A console is the combination of a monitor and keyboard. 
                       It is a rudimentary interface in which the monitor provides
                        the output and the keyboard is used for input. While any computer with a monitor
                         and keyboard may be considered a console, the term most often refers to a system 
                         used to control one or more servers.</p>
